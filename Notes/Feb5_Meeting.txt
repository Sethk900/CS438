CS438 - Initial Project Meeting Notes
05 February 2021

Purpose of meeting: Identify what we can and cannot do 

What Costas had in mind:
	- A GNS3 implementation of what a TOR structure would look like
	- So, whenever Bob and Alice want to gain anonymity, they can use that structure. 
	- That is, we will have to implement servers

Tor has an input layer and exit layer, and has several layers in between. Two hosts communicate through this structure. 
As a first step, create this infrastructure in GNS3. 
	- The software for the input/ouptut/layer servers are open source

So, set up input/output layer, create several layers, and be able to take advantage of the network structure as if it were a real TOR structure as if it were a real 
TOR infrastructure. 

We will have to create Docker containers or VMs that have the Tor software running. 
	- Emphasized that either VMs or containers would be acceptable for this task
	- This is the most important goal

EXTRA CREDIT: Set up a hidden service that is a service inside the infrastructure, and which hosts can access from outside of the layers.
	- Basically hiding a server in the layers

Before we start out working on the GNS3 part of this project, we should get familiar with how TOR works (i.e. understand the fundamental routing concepts)

Explain, in our presentation:
	- How TOR works
	- What one can achieve with TOR (in terms of anonymity)
	- What this means in terms of hidden services
	- How we implemented a TOR-like service in GNS3

Possible directions: implement already-existing Tor services in GNS3
	- Write python scripts that mimic Tor onion routing to provide anonymity to users
	- Forget about the implementation: investigate how to break anonymity (this will be reading-intensive, identifying and analyszing papers that explain how to break Tor)

By the time that we meet for the midterm exam, we should have a clear vision of which direction we want to take for the project. So, prior to this meeting:
	- Research/learn about Tor
	- Decide which direction to go in with the project
	- Take the first steps towards pursuing that option (i.e. download/play around with Tor VMs or identify 3 or 4 papers that we want to analyze)

Components of project:
	1. Cryptographic (describe how Tor works)
	2. Application (explain why it matters)
	3. Implementation (emulate it)
		a. GNS3
		b. Python
		c. Survey
