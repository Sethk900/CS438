Dr. Kolias
CS438 - Semester Project Standup Meeting 
19 February 2021

Updates:
	- Project team members watched the study material videos that Dr. Kolias provided to us via BBLearn
	- Consensus is that our of the 3 project options presented to us, we will pursue a Tor implementation on GNS3 
		- If we have time, we may also attempt to implement a hidden service
	- The implmentation won't be conceptually difficult, but the technical details could get messy

Collaboration methods:
	- GNS3 does not allow for easy collaboration. How we might get around this:
		- During working sessions, have one person editing the topology and everyone else can provide input
		- Everyone can attempt to implement simple TOR topologies on their own
		- Code and other files can still be shared over Discord, a fileshare, or GitHub

Action items going forward:
	- Midterm coming up on March 11:
		- Know how TOR works (and be able to explain technical details)
		- Be able to explain our goals for the project and timeline prior to the end of the semester 
	- Prior to 26Feb standup:
		- Solidify technical understanding of TOR and start to think about specifics of our GNS3 implementation
		- If you have time, start to play around with messaging/routing scripts that could be used for a simple TOR GNS3 implementation
		- Check out the resources that Keller shared over Discord (Tor Project FAQs/Ubuntu VM installation instructions)

Next standup is 26Feb
